The  **Tournament Scheduler**is a robust, object-oriented application designed to simplify the management of sports tournaments. It implements full CRUD operations to handle match scheduling seamlessly. Hereâ€™s what it offers:

**Create**: Automatically generate matches by pairing teams. Simply input the team names, and the scheduler efficiently creates all possible match combinations with unique IDs.

**Read**: Easily view the entire match schedule in an organized, tabular format. The scheduler displays details such as match IDs, participating teams, and the scheduled date and time, ensuring all stakeholders have a clear view.

**Update**: Modify existing match details, such as the date or time, with simple inputs. This feature allows flexibility to adjust the schedule dynamically based on changing requirements.

**Delete**: Cancel matches efficiently due to unforeseen circumstances, such as weather disruptions. The system ensures matches are removed from the schedule with minimal effort, maintaining a clean and conflict-free schedule.

Additional features include conflict detection, which ensures no two matches are scheduled at the same time, and an intuitive interface for a smooth user experience. The scheduler is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable, making it an essential tool for tournament organizers.
